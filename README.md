## Kernel Compilation with Serial Bridge Driver
  Perform the following to compile the kernel with Serial Bridge driver.

   1. Get the kernel source from Linux4wilc GitHub repository using the following command:
      ```
        $ git clone https://github.com/linux4wilc/linux-at91.git'
        $ cd linux-at91'
      ```    
   2. Create the kernel using sama5_defconfig defconfig file, using the following command:
       ``` 
        $ make ARCH=arm sama5_defconfig'
       ``` 
   3. Add the wilcsbridge driver in kernel's directory `$ "/drivers/staging/"` as provided in the release package "src"
   folder, using the following command:
     ``` 
      $ cp -rf ../src/wilcsbridge ../linux-at91/drivers/staging/
     ``` 
   4. To include the wilcsbridge driver in the kernel build, relevant Kconfig and Makefile must be changed as
   following:
     ``` 
      $ vi linux-at91/drivers/staging/Kconfig
     ``` 
   Add the following:
     ``` 
        source "drivers/staging/wilcsbridge/Kconfig"
        $ vi linux-at91/drivers/staging/Makefile
     ``` 
   Add the following:
      ```
        obj-$(CONFIG_WILCSBRIDGE) += wilcsbridge/
      ```  
   5. To include the wilcsbridge driver in the kernel build, modify the default configuration using the `S“menuconfig”`
   parameter in "Device Drivers > staging Driver > Select wilcsbridge SPI/SDIO" and select as modules.
     ``` 
      $ make ARCH=arm menuconfig
     ``` 
   6. Save and exit from the menuconfig configuration page.
   7. Modify the Device Tree files for SDIO or SPI for ATWILC1000/ATWILC3000. Modify the files for UART
   interface for ATWILC3000 only. Sample Device Tree is based on the SAMA5D4_Xplained Pro board. User
   must modify the Device Tree node based on the used MPU. Mainly, the GPIO changes for CHIP_EN and
   RESETN pin detials must be added for SPI interface on wilc_sdio node of mmc1 and UART for BLE interface.
   
   - For SDIO Interface:
        ```
          For SD/MMC node:
            mmc1: mmc@fc000000 {
            pinctrl-names = "default";
            pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_mmc1_clk_cmd_dat0 &pinctrl_mmc1_dat1_3>;
            vmmc-supply = <&vcc_mmc1_reg>;
            vqmmc-supply = <&vcc_3v3_reg>;
            non-removable;
            status = "okay";
              wilc_sdio@0{
              compatible = "microchip,wilc1000", "microchip,wilc3000";
              irq-gpios = <&pioC 27 0>;
              reset-gpios = <&pioB 28 0>;
              chip_en-gpios = <&pioC 30 0>;
              status = "okay";
              reg = <0>;
              bus-width = <4>;
              };
            };
        ``` 
        
   - For SPI Interface:
        ```
          spi1: spi@fc018000 {
          cs-gpios = <&pioB 21 0>;
          status = "okay";
            wilc_spi@0 {
            compatible = "microchip,wilc1000", "microchip,wilc3000";
            spi-max-frequency = <48000000>;
            irq-gpios = <&pioB 26 0>;
            reset-gpios = <&pioE 21 0>;
            chip_en-gpios = <&pioB 27 0>;
            reg = <0>;
            status = "okay";
            };
          };
        ``` 
   - For ATWILC3000 BLE UART interface:         

        ```
          usart4: serial@fc010000 {
          atmel,use-dma-rx;
          atmel,use-dma-tx;
          status = "okay";
          };
        ``` 
   8. To build the kernel image and Device Tree binary file .dtb, generate the build using the following commands:
       ```
        $ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=...../arm-linux-gnueabihf- zImage modules dtbs
       ``` 
      Kernel build generates the zImage, `$at91-sama5d4_xplained.dtb`, `$wilcsridge-sdio.ko`, and/or `$wilcsbridge-spi.ko` files.

       ```  
        "$ demo_linux_nandflash.sh".
       ```
   5. Add the jumper at JP7 and connect to the PC via the USB port at J11.
   6. Reset the board to enter in to "ROMboot" and remove the jumper JP7.
   7. Execute demo_linux_nandflash.bat (for Windows®) or `$demo_linux_nandflash.sh` (for Linux).
   8. After successful flashing, copy the modules `$"drivers/staging/wilcsbridge/wilcsbridge-sdio.ko"` and `$"drivers/staging/wilcsbridge/wilcsbridge-spi.ko"`   based on the used interface.

## UART Configuration for Serial Bridge Application
   In SAMA5D4 Xplained Pro board, UART0 is used for Serial Bridge communication. By default UART0 is disabled. nable the UART0 in Device Tree .dtsi file.
   For the UART0 `$"/dev/ttyS5"` device is created in the Serial Bridge application. This is also used to transmit and receive the data from the GUI tool.
 
   **Note:** For other MPU's use any available UART and respective `$"/dev/ttyxx"` device.
  
## Pin Configuration for SAMA5D4 with ATWILC1000 SPI Interface
   The Linux Serial Bridge driver acts as a reference to the SAMA5D4 Xplained pro board. EXT1 header pin configuration is used for SPI interface, Rest,   Chip_En, and IRQ.
   
   ### Pin Configuration for SAMA5D4 with ATWILC1000 SPI Interface
      ```
        **Description**    **EXT1 of SAMA5D4 Xplained Pro Board**
        SPI MISO    -        17 pin
        SPI MOSI    -        16 pin
        SPI SCK     -        18 pin
        SPI SS      -        15 pin
        RESET       -        5 pin
        CHIP_EN     -        10 pin
        IRQ         -        9 pin (optional for Serial bridge application)
       ```
  
   **Note:** The SPI interface pins are configured using Device Tree of the Linux kernel. The RESET and CHIP_EN pins are configured in the `$"wilc_spi.c"` driver itself using GPIO numbers.
  
## Test Procedure
   1. Flash the Linux kernel image in to the SAMA5D4 MPU. For more details, refer [ATWILC Linux User Guide](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ATWILC1000-ATWILC3000-Wi-Fi-Link-Controller-Linux-User-Guide-DS70005328B.pdf).
   2. Connect the ATWILC1000 SPI interface board to EXT1 or SD board to SDIO interface connector.
   3. Connect the FTDI cable Rx - Yellow (ET2 header - pin 12) and Tx - Orange (ET2 header - pin 11) and Windows PC for GUI tool communication.
   4. Follow the MCHPRT2 user guide for production and validation.
